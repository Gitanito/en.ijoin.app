# Boost Attendance and Simplify Planning for Your Shop Floor Breakfasts

Are you tired of the guesswork involved when planning your next **team gathering** or **workshop breakfast**? You need a headcount to know how much coffee to brew or how many chairs to pull out, but chasing down RSVPs feels like another full-time job. Imagine knowing exactly who is coming—and if they’re bringing a guest—with zero friction for your team members.

## The Frustration of Vague Headcounts and Awkward Delays

You send out the email, maybe a quick message in the workshop chat, and then the waiting game begins. Half the team replies with a quick "Yes," others don't reply at all, and you’re left wondering if you should order breakfast for 10 or 30 people. It’s not just about the wasted food or the surprise rush; it’s about the **disruption to your workflow**. You’re a foreman, a leader—your time should be spent managing the craft, not chasing down confirmations for a simple **team event coordination**. The current method—the reply-all chain or the messy spreadsheet—is costing you focus and creating unnecessary hassle for your crew.
