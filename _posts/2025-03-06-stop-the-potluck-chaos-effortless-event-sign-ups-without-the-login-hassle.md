# Effortless Potluck Planning for Shared Meals and Community Events

Are you the unofficial "Kümmerer"—the go-to person in your shared living situation, club, or circle responsible for organizing the next great potluck dinner? You love bringing people together, but you dread the endless group chat threads and the uncertainty of who is actually showing up, let alone what they're bringing. You need a reliable way to manage RSVPs for your next shared meal or community gathering, and you need it fast, without forcing your guests to download yet another app or remember another password.

## The Frustration of Fragmented Invitations

You’ve sent out the initial invitation. Now, the chaos begins. A dozen replies scattered across WhatsApp, a few emails, and a couple of late texts. You’re constantly updating a physical list or a confusing spreadsheet. Did Sarah say she was bringing a salad or a dessert? Is Tom bringing his partner? How many people do you actually need to cook for?

This fragmented communication makes you feel **overwhelmed and disorganized**. The simple joy of hosting quickly turns into administrative burden. You want to focus on the community and the food, not on chasing down replies. And frankly, your guests are just as annoyed. They want to say "Yes!" quickly, but the moment they see a requirement to create an account or install an app, their enthusiasm wanes, and your response rate drops. The effort required to simply RSVP is the biggest hurdle to a successful gathering.
